I don't know how you feel about the service for Google Plus or why you think adaptation for this Google social network isn't as 
prevalent as say Facebook. I think its a competent web app but somehow being free and clear and sterile makes it seem empty. 
I have a space for my content on Google Plus if you'd like to visit, I'd like to see it grow in use and be as sucessful as 
it can be.
