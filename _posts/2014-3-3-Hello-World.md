title: New Blog Home

I'm trying to make this my new home for blogging. I've done a blog on indie game development in the past and I'll try to migrate that over here. It includes content about developer conferences and indie games I've helped develop and I've seen others develop. Look forward to some great stuff I can put up here. Also there is some fabulous content I can put up here from my youtube channel at http://www.youtube.com/users/maximumcritrate see you there.
